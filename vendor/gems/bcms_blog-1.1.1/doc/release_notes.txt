v1.1.0

This version introduces significant changes and improvements over version 1.0.0
and lays the groundwork for a more sophisticated blogging platform for BrowserCMS.

Notable Features:
=================

1. A Blog and supporting structure (sections, pages, page routes, etc.) and data are no longer 
   created as part of the modules's installation process. When running the module's migrations,
   only the following items are created:
   
   * blogs, blog_posts and blog_comment tables (and corresponding tables to hold versioning data)
   * blog_group_memberships table
   * Blog, BlogPost and BlogComment content types
   * Blog Post category type
   
2. It is only until a Blog is created when a corresponding section, pages, page routes and portlets are created.
   Each blog has its own section, pages and page routes, which allows for multiple blogs to be created.

3. It is now possible to add attachments to blog posts.

4. Comments are moderated by default using BrowserCMS' default behaviors. However, when creating a Blog,
   users can specify whether comments should be published automatically.
   
5. The module now uses BrowserCMS' permissions framework to specify if a particular user is able to
   create or edit Blogs and BlogPosts.

6. Portlets have been improved to match common standard blog publishing templates.
